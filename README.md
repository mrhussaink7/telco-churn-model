## Overview

Customer churn is a critical issue for telecom companies, as retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project aims to build and evaluate models that predict customer churn using the Telco Customer Churn dataset. By understanding the factors that influence churn, the company can implement strategies to improve customer retention.

As a data scientist, my goal is to analyze the dataset, develop predictive models, and provide actionable insights to help the company reduce churn rates and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Challenge

Our goal is to predict customer churn and provide actionable recommendations to boost business revenue. Using the Telco Customer Churn dataset, we identify key factors influencing churn and suggest strategies to enhance retention. Our evidence-based recommendations aim to deliver tangible benefits for the company.

## Datasets

In the folder `zippedData`, we have datasets from:

- [Kaggle, Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)

## Solution

This project builds predictive churn models using Logistic Regression and Decision Trees. By comparing their performance through metrics like accuracy and ROC-AUC, focusing on `Recall` we identify the best model for predicting customer churn. The insights gained will help inform strategies to improve customer retention and reduce churn rates.
